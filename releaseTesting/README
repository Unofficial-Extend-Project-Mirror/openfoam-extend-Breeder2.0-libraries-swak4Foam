#+TITLE: Virtual machines for testing and Packaging
* Prerequisites
  These virtual machines require
  - VirtualBox :: for running
  - Vagrant :: to automatically set them up
* Starting
  A virtual machine is set up with
: vagrant up <machineName>
  will download a virtual machine image and set it up. It will then
  modify the image:
  - add packages required to compile swak4Foam and package them
  - install binary packages of OpenFOAM
  - mount the directory of the sources
  - from this directory clone it to the local disc with mercurial
  One can then connect to the virtual machine with
: vagrant ssh <machinName>
  and will be in the =$HOME= directory of the user =vagrant= where in
  the directory =swak4Foam= the sources are available. Modifications
  can be pushed "outside" the virtual machine with
: hg push
* Virtual machines
  Currently existing virtual machines are
  - precise :: Latest LTS Ubuntu. This has the most recent
               OF-binaries but *not* 1.7.x
  - lucid :: Previous LTS Ubuntu. Has 1.7.x but currently problems
             with automatic setting up (something with the
             =postfix=-package)
  - maverick :: Tries to fix the problems with the
                =lucid=-machine. Not yet working
