Subject: Manipulating Time with functionObjects
Message-Id: <c12ad3817236b635-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

Add in the simpleFunctionObjects the Basis for FOs to manipulate
Time. Maybe make panicDump a child of those.

Ideas would be to manipulate deltaT. But unsure whether this will be
picked up correctly
