Message-Id: <e9a2dc7e48db62da-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

functionObject that reads a field and updates the boundary
conditions. This would allow post-processing-fields for boundaries. 

Possible alternate implementation: construct the field and its
boundary conditions from a dictionary in the FO-specification (for
selected patches)
