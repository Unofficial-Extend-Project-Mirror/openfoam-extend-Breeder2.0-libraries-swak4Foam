Subject: Check laplacian-operators
Message-Id: <e814990e00563227-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

In the 1.x-branch certain variants of the laplacian operators were
commented out because their runtime-selection-table was present in OF

This should be rechecked in more UpToDate-versions

Parts affected are
- the Field-parser
- The fvc-plugin functions
