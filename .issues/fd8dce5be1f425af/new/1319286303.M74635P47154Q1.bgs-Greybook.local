Subject: Generalize simpleFunctionObjects data-writing to allow CSV-files
Message-Id: <fd8dce5be1f425af-0-artemis@bgs-Greybook.local>

Introduce a writeLine-method to write data-files with different
separators. 

Would need some additions in the infrastructure.

Alternative is still to convert files to CSV by scripts
