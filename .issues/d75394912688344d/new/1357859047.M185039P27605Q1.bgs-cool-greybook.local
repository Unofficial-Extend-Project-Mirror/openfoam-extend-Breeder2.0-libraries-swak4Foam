Subject: Function object to collect variable values in parallel runs
Message-Id: <d75394912688344d-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

This would take a global variable from all th processeors and generate
one long array with all the values. This would allow algorithms that
are not parallelized (for instance Python-snipplets) to evaluate all
the data at once
