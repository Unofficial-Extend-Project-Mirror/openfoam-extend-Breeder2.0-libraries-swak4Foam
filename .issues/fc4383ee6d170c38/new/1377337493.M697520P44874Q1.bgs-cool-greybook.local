Subject: Separate directories for output on parallel Python
Message-Id: <fc4383ee6d170c38-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

If a run is parallel and not in master-only mode then each processor
should get a separate directory (unless being asked to)

Maybe introduce a python variable master-only or so
