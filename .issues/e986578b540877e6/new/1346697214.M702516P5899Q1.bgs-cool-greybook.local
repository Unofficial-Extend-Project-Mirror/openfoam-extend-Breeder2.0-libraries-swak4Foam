Subject: Non-uniform fields into python-integration
Message-Id: <e986578b540877e6-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

Allow the python integration to accept non-uniform fields as input and
put them into arrays. Same for going back out.

Possibly together with numpy to allow quick calculations on these arrays
