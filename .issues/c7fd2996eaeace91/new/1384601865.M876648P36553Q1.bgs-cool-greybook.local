Subject: Unify handling of sets and make programs check for them in memory
Message-Id: <c7fd2996eaeace91-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

Currently cell/face/point-Sets are read by similar boilerplate code
and always read from disk

Solution: unify into one procedure and try to read from memory if
possible (maybe it is possible to register the sets in a registry)
