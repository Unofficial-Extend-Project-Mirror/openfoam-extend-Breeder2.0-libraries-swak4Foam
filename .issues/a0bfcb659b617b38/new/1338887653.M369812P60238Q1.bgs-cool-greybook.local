Subject: Indicator function whether faces are on patches
Message-Id: <a0bfcb659b617b38-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

A function "onPatch(inlet)" that returns a boolean for all faces which
are on the names patch

This should be fixed together with bab71cb82a64af3b (otherwise it
makes no sense anyway)
