Subject: Plugin-system for creating pseudo-fields
Message-Id: <eb604cf6242ae559-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

The idea would be to for instance specify a library =meshInfo= that
"defines" pseudoFields like =nonOrtho= to allow access to the
non-orthogonality engine of =checkMesh=. Other applications would be
accessing the turbulence-properties ...
