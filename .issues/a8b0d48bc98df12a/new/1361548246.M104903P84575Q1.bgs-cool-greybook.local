Subject: Plugin-function for evaluation of expression on other mesh
Message-Id: <a8b0d48bc98df12a-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

The syntax would be

: evaluateElsewhere(meshName,expr)

and evaluate =expr= on the mesh specified as =meshName=

Only problem would be that plugin-functions have to return a specific
type and that is not known beforehand for =expr=
