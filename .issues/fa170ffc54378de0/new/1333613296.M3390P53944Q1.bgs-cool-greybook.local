Subject: Point-interpolation for subsets
Message-Id: <fa170ffc54378de0-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

The various subset-classes have an incomplete support of
point-interpolation

Would make sense for
- zones
- sets
- sampledSurfaces

If this is fixed the change for construction of vectors
https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=130
will also be added
